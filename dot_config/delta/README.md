# Delta

Better git diff experience for the command line.

## Themes

Delta uses bat for syntax highlighting.  So you need to theme both bat and delta to get a consistent look.

* Bat - https://github.com/catppuccin/bat

On windows delta uses bat as a library and in theory should load themes autoatically from the themes sub folder of delta conifg - not sure this is fully working
